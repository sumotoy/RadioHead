# RadioHead
Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors

CAUTION! CUrrent Release has still some bugs and it's not working properly so do not use.
I will inform when fixed.

Finally get really working with Teensy3 and fully SPI Transaction compatible, this allow me to use together with other SPI devices.
