# RadioHead
Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors

This variation has been sincronized to last distro but added SPI Transactions (completely absent before) and more compatibility with all Teensy's (3,3.1,LC).<br>
This library it's great but it's a mess to put hands on, takes hours digging code so don't complain!<br>
I have cloned because Paul Stoffregen's was seamlessy work but not totally SPI Transaction compatible and I got problems with other devices, also the original library grows and was updated but Paul's version not (I know Paul you have tons of better stuff to do!).<br>
Caution since it's still a working on, I have tested with 2xTeensy3.1 and 2 NRF96+PA only!
